## Flappy Bird

This program is a clone of the popular mobile game Flappy Bird. The goal of the game is to keep the bird (ball)
                        from hitting the pipes. This was also built as more of a demo, so instead of the player losing when the ball hits a pipe,
                        the pipe simply turns red. The player cannot win or lose. Controls are spacebar to move up.
